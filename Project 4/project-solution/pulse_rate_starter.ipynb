    ">   - how the algorithm works\n",

    ">   - a describtion of the algorithm outputs\n",
    ">   - caveats on algorithm outputs \n",
    ">   - common failure modes\n",
    "> - **Algorithm Performance** - Detail how performance was computed (eg. using cross-validation or train-test split) and what metrics were optimized for. Include error metrics that would be relevant to users of your algorithm. Caveat your performance numbers by acknowledging how generalizable they may or may not be on different datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Description**: The code can be excuted by calling the Evaluate() function, which will load the data, compute, and return the aggregated error metric.\n",

    "**Data Description**: The data provided is for 3-dimentional accelerometer sensor (x,y,z)-axis as well as a PPG sensor signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithhm Description**: After loading the data, it is then passed to a bandpass filter to eliminate unnecessary range based on the required cut-off frequencies. The signal above the upper cut-off and lower than the lowest cut-off are eliminated. The accelerometer magnitude is then computed by finding the absolute sum of square of the 3-axises. Then both BPM and confidence values are computed based on a 8s window length. Once the heart rate s estimatd, the error is computed and returned as a final output.\n",
